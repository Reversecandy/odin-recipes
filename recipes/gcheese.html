    <p>Here is another basic quick meal to make and one of my favorite things to
        eat although I dont eat it often. The steps to make it are below.
    </p>
    <!--recipe begins-->
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet to medium low while you take 2 slices of cheese and sandwich
            them between 2 slice of bread
        </li>

        <li>Next you want to spread some fat on the bread so it doesnt stick then cook
            until lightly brown (3 to 4 minutes)
        </li>
        
        <li>Now flip it and repeat till the other side is browned,let it cool then enjoy.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Thats the end for the recipe now you just have to enjoy the food you made
        its pretty simple.
    </p>
