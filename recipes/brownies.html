    <!--beginning intro and stuff required for recipe-->
    <p>We have a <strong>simple brownie</strong> recipe for you choclate lovers and were gonna go over it step by step</p>

    <p>The ingrediants you are gonna need are butter,sugar,cocoa powder,eggs,salt and vanilla,and finaly
        all purpose flower. Then for the tools needed it will be a mixing bowl, a small saucepan, and a 
        spoon, and a 8 inch or similar baking pan.
    </p>
        <!--step by step list of what they need to do begins-->
        <ol>
            <!--first step-->
            <li>Melt the butter with sugar,salt and cocoa powder </li>
            <p>We will do this by taking our saucepan and filling it with a couple inches of water then
                put it over low heat on the stove and place our bowl filled with butter sugar and cocoa powder
                ove the saucepan till it turns into a gritty-looking texture.
            </p>
            <!--2nd step-->
            <li>Add the vanilla and eggs</li>
            <p>After it has that texture we add one egg to the bowl of butter,sugar,and the cocoa powder
                and mix it then add a second egg and mix it.
            </p>
            <!--3rd step-->
            <li>Add the flour</li>
            <P>Mix the flour (1/2 cup) into the batter and then beat the batter with a spoon for around  40 to 50 
                strokes until it is thick which will make it bake better in the oven.
            </P>
            <!--4th step-->
            <li>Bake it</li>
            <p>Put it in a 8 inch (or similar) square pan and bake for around 20 minutes. Once it gets to twenty minutes
                watch it and try and see when the edges look done and the middle is a little underdone to stop it. Or a 
                simpler method is to use a timer but it might not be quite as good.
            </p>
            <!--Last step-->
            <li>Let it cool down and enjoy</li>
            <p>The timing for this will vary but once its done you have made your very own brownies.</p>
        </ol>
